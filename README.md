# Arduino-based Monophonic Synthesizer 
## By Brett Anley 

### What? 
- Design and build a uniquely playable and programmable electrical instrument controlled by a Elegoo Mega 2560 Microcontroller

### How? 
- Fashioned main user interface from six buttons, two 0.5-Watt speakers, and a 200 mm softpot membrane potentiometer
- Programming for the project was done on the Arduino IDE using the Arduino language which could be considered a simplified version of C++
- Designed the first button for playing the programmable songs, and the other five buttons correlate to a different frequency
- Softpot membrane potentiometer was divided into six different sections, so depending on the placement of oneâ€™s finger, the frequency of the note being played would change

### Results 
- Produced a uniquely playable and programmable electrical instrument
- Improvements could be made in the quality of the speakers used and the quality of sound produced for each note
